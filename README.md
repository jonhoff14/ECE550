# ECE550

Code for final project of ECE 550 - Advanced Robotic Planning.

This robotics class culminated with the final assignment to implement motion planning for the KUKA youBot in ROS.
My partner Usman Syed and I implemented RRT for planning a collision-free path for both the youBot base
around several boxes to a set way point.
We also implemented this for the youBotâ€™s robotic arm to enter a confined space.
