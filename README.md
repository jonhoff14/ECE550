# youBot RRT motion planning
Authors: Jonathan Hoff and Usman Syed

This code implements motion planning for the KUKA youBot in ROS Gazebo environment.

1) youBot base path planning
We use RRT for planning a collision-free path for the youBot base around several boxes to a set way point.

2) youBot arm path planning
We also implemented this for the youBotâ€™s robotic arm to enter a confined space.
