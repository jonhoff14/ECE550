# youBot RRT motion planning

Code for final project of ECE 550 - Advanced Robotic Planning.
Developed by: Jonathan Hoff and Usman Syed

This code implements motion planning for the KUKA youBot in ROS.
We use RRT for planning a collision-free path for the youBot base around several boxes to a set way point.
We also implemented this for the youBotâ€™s robotic arm to enter a confined space.
